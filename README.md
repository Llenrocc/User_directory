# Employee Directory

Employee Directory is an easy to use React application that allows the user to create and populate random users and store them in a directory. You are able to search by Name, email, and DOB.

## Directions

- Open up terminal, and create new directory (mkdir).  
- Once the new directory has been created, clone (cope and paste repo link) the repo into your directory.
- Once you have cloned the repo in your local directory, run `npm start`
- This begins running the application
- If the application does not open up on it's own, you can view it in your browser by searching http://localhost:3000.
- If you are making any changes, the page will automatically reload once you save.

## Challenges

I think I have written all the code that is needed. However I am receiving this error message when I run `npm start`.

```src/utils/API.js
  Line 3:1:  Assign object to a variable before exporting as module default  import/no-anonymous-default-export```

I have tried troubleshooting with google etc, and I am not just not 100% sure on what is exactly that i need to fix. I have seen online, similar code written, and I am not sure what i am missing. The code is under Master branch in Github, not main.
